I was asked recently to write a bio of myself for a job. Here's what I came
up with.

Multi-disciplined developer/designer specializing in the www. Wants to use code to better the world by making & sharing innovative software.

**In 140 words**

After graduating from APIIT in 2004, Zaim co-founded an IT solutions company,
DTEC (Devest Technology Sdn Bhd).

There, he worked within multiple disciplines and roles – from graphic design
to software delopment, as a programmer to lead engineer. It was there, in a
small startup in Klang, that he learned to appreciate the saying, “Jack of
all trades, master of none, certainly better than a master of one.”

In 2010, this Jack decided to go freelance and become somewhat master of the
World (Wide Web). He worked on an assortment of jobs online, and on his own
menagerie of personal web app projects.

Along the way, he has worked on and contributed to many Free / Open Source
software.

With his experience, and his love of programming, he aims to build things
(through code) that can affect change in the world.
